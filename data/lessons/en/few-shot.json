  "content": "## What is Few-shot Prompting?\n\nFew-shot Prompting is a method that **provides a few examples** to guide AI to learn desired patterns.\n\n\"Few-shot\" means \"a small number of examples.\"\n\n### Zero-shot vs Few-shot\n\n| Type | Zero-shot | Few-shot |\n|------|-----------|----------|\n| Examples | None | 2-5 provided |\n| Best for | Simple summaries, concept explanation | Policy case comparison, consistent format analysis |\n| Policy use | Stakeholder analysis | Multi-country policy comparison |\n\n### When to use it in policy research?\n\n- Comparing policies across countries with **consistent criteria**\n- Summarizing policy documents in **uniform format**\n- **Classifying and analyzing** policy success/failure cases\n- Organizing research abstracts in **standardized structure**\n\n### Few-shot Prompt Structure\n\n```\n[Task description]\n\nExample 1:\nPolicy: [Policy A]\nAnalysis: [Analysis Result A]\n\nExample 2:\nPolicy: [Policy B]\nAnalysis: [Analysis Result B]\n\nActual task:\nPolicy: [Policy to analyze]\nAnalysis:\n```\n\n### Tips for Choosing Good Examples\n\n1. **Diversity**: Include developed/developing countries, success/failure cases\n2. **Representativeness**: Choose typical policy cases\n3. **Consistency**: Maintain the same analytical framework\n4. **Right amount**: 2-5 is appropriate (too many causes confusion)\n\n### Cautions\n\n- Example quality determines analysis quality\n- Biased examples lead to biased analysis\n- Examples from different policy contexts cause confusion",
