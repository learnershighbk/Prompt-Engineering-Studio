  "content": "## What is Zero-shot Prompting?\n\nZero-shot Prompting is a method of requesting desired results from AI **without providing examples**, using only task instructions.\n\n\"Zero-shot\" means \"zero examples.\"\n\n### When to use it in policy research?\n\n- Summarizing policy documents and extracting key arguments\n- Defining and explaining policy concepts\n- Stakeholder listing and position analysis\n- Policy terminology explanation\n- Applying basic frameworks (SWOT, PEST, etc.)\n\n### Policy Analysis Examples\n\n**Policy Summary:**\n```\nSummarize the key points of this World Bank report in 3 bullet points.\nTarget audience: Policy analysts at the Ministry of Finance.\n\n[Report content]\n```\n\n**Stakeholder Analysis:**\n```\nAnalyze the key stakeholders for 'Universal Basic Income' policy.\n\nFormat as:\n| Stakeholder | Position | Key Concerns | Influence |\n```\n\n**Development Indicator Interpretation:**\n```\nInterpret the HDI changes for Rwanda and\nderive policy implications.\n- HDI: 0.534 (2021) → 0.548 (2023)\n```\n\n### How to Write Effective Zero-shot Prompts\n\n1. **Specify analysis target clearly**: Which policy, country, time period\n2. **Define output format**: Table, bullet points, essay format\n3. **State target audience**: Policymakers, researchers, students\n4. **Set length constraints**: Number of sentences, words\n\n### Limitations\n\n- Not suitable for complex multi-step analysis\n- Few-shot is more effective for consistent format repetitive tasks\n- May need examples when applying specific analytical frameworks",
