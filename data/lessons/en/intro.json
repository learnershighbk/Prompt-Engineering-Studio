  "content": "## What is Prompt Engineering?\n\nPrompt Engineering is the skill of **designing effective inputs (prompts) to get desired results from AI models**.\n\n### Why is it important for policy students?\n\nEven with the same AI model, the quality of policy analysis varies significantly depending on how you write the prompt.\n\n**Bad example:**\n```\nAnalyze climate policy\n```\n\n**Good example:**\n```\nAnalyze the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\nusing Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework.\nInclude: problem stream, policy stream, political stream, and policy window.\nTarget audience: Master's students in public policy.\n```\n\n### AI Applications in Policy Research\n\n- **Literature Review**: Summarizing policy documents and extracting key arguments\n- **Policy Briefs**: Drafting structured policy reports\n- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Analyzing policy impacts from multiple perspectives\n- **Comparative Policy Analysis**: Cross-country and temporal policy comparisons\n\n### 3 Principles of Good Prompts\n\n1. **Clarity**: Specify analysis target, scope, and perspective\n2. **Context**: Provide theoretical frameworks and background information\n3. **Format**: Specify desired output format (table, bullet points, essay, etc.)\n\n### What You'll Learn\n\n- **Zero-shot Prompting**: Policy summaries, concept explanations\n- **Few-shot Prompting**: Consistent format for policy case analysis\n- **Chain of Thought**: Complex policy effect reasoning and causal analysis",
