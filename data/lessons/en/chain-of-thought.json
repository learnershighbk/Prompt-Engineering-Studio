  "content": "## What is Chain of Thought (CoT)?\n\nChain of Thought is a technique that **guides AI to explain its thinking process step by step** to analyze complex policy problems.\n\nIt means \"chain of reasoning,\" making the AI explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps.\n\n### Why is it effective for policy analysis?\n\n- **Tracing causal relationships** of policy effects\n- **Predicting reactions** of multiple stakeholders\n- Identifying **unintended consequences**\n- Reducing logical errors and **enabling verification**\n- **Breaking down** complex policy problems into smaller steps\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n**Method 1: Direct request**\n```\nPlease analyze the effects of this policy step by step.\n```\n\n**Method 2: Add \"Let's think step by step\"**\n```\nAnalyze the impact of minimum wage increase on employment.\nLet's think step by step.\n```\n\n**Method 3: Specify analysis steps**\n```\nPlease analyze according to these steps:\nStep 1: Identify direct policy effects\nStep 2: Predict stakeholder reactions\nStep 3: Analyze secondary and ripple effects\nStep 4: Infer long-term equilibrium\nStep 5: Comprehensive evaluation and recommendations\n```\n\n### Zero-shot CoT vs Few-shot CoT\n\n| Type | Zero-shot CoT | Few-shot CoT |\n|------|---------------|---------------|\n| Method | Add \"step by step\" keyword | Provide reasoning examples |\n| Simplicity | Very simple | Requires writing examples |\n| Best for | General policy analysis | Specific analytical frameworks |\n\n### Policy Applications\n\n- **Policy effect reasoning**: Causal chain analysis\n- **Cost-benefit analysis**: Step-by-step cost/benefit identification\n- **Stakeholder analysis**: Sequential prediction of group reactions\n- **Scenario analysis**: Conditional outcome reasoning\n- **Policy alternative evaluation**: Systematic criteria-based comparison",
